# 🏠 House Price Prediction — Kaggle Competition

This repository contains a machine learning project developed for the **Kaggle competition: [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)**.  
The goal is to predict the final sale prices of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, based on various explanatory features describing different aspects of the properties.

## 📘 Project Description

This notebook demonstrates a full **end-to-end data science workflow** — from data cleaning and feature engineering to model selection and evaluation.

The project applies multiple **regression techniques** to predict house prices and compares their performance to identify the most accurate model.  
It serves as a practical example of applying **machine learning** to real-world structured data.

### 🔍 Key Highlights
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify key variables and relationships.  
- Handled missing values, outliers, and categorical features with appropriate preprocessing techniques.  
- Engineered new features and applied **scaling and encoding** methods.  
- Trained and compared several models:
  - Linear Regression  
  - Ridge and Lasso Regression  
  - Random Forest  
  - Gradient Boosting and XGBoost  
- Evaluated models using **Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE)** — Kaggle’s competition metric.
